These materials form the basis of carbon removal purchases under the [Frontier](https://frontierclimate.com/) advance market commitment.

- Our [template project application](./TEMPLATE%20Project%20Application), including modular supplements for Direct Air Capture, Surface Mineralization, Biomass, Oceans, Geologic Injection, and CO2 Utilization.
     - This template application was developed in collaboration with [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org). They are hosting an unbranded version of the application content in markdown format [on GitHub](https://github.com/carbonplan/carbon-removal-application). Please consider using it!
- The [template review forms](./TEMPLATE%20Review%20Forms) that our science and governance reviewers use to provide feedback against Frontier's purchase criteria.
